<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Md Irfan. I have done my schooling from Kolkata, West Bengal. My native place is Bihar, which i used to visit during my summer vactions. After completing my schooling i along with my friends decided to do engineering. My WBJEE rank was around 20000 but instead of getting admitted in a college in Kolkata. I decided to get enrolled in a college in Jaipur, Rajasthan. After completing the 4 years of engineering, i got placed in TCS through college campusing but somehow it was not in my fate to join IT industry at that time and i decided to do a diploma in Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning the October, 2016. I got a job on the basis of this diploma in December, 2016 in Raipur, Chattisgarh as a design cum project engineer at a salary of Rs. 10,000 per month. After working for 3-4 months, i started looking for opportunities in my hometown and got a job in kolkata as a planning enginner at a salary of Rs. 15,000 per month and was receiving the salary on a delay of at least one month every time. After working for 3.5 years in this company, i joined Voltas Limited as a Sales Engineer in December 2020 and have been promoted to Assiatant Mangaer last year. I am very keen to learn about the web development and regret not joining the TCS.  </p>
